3DMM Pencil++ 2
===============
**3DMM Pencil++** is versatile (although somewhat esoteric) utility for examining and editing data files from the 1995 Microsoft Kids software title [3D Movie Maker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Movie_Maker) (3DMM). The utility allows users to expand 3DMM by creating their own or editing existing movie elements. It is also useful for extracting music, sounds, textures, images, video frames, 3D models, and more.

**3DMM Pencil++ 2** was to be a complete rewrite of 3DMM Pencil++ with features such as:
- Resizable Window
- Copying and Pasting Quads
- View/Edit Plugin and Hex View Visible from Main Window
- Smarter Reference Tracking
- Faster Performance
- Macros
- And More? (It's been awhile...)

Some of those features were finished, but many of them were not. It was left to the vultures after I, Frank Weindel, went off to college in 2006. I'm posting it here for anyone who wants to peek at it and maybe tinker with it. These days, thanks to Github and other repo services, its so much easier to get people together to collaborate on software.

The code has been fixed up a bit and it should compile out of the box with *Visual Studio 2010*. It also seems to compile great in *VS 2013 Express*, however you'd be missing a resource editor.

Todo
----
- Gather plugin code and add it to the solution.
- Fix up 3DMM Pencil++ (prequel to this) source code and post it to github.
